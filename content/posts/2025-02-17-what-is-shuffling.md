What is shuffling and how is it different from jogging and running?
- keep feet low to the ground
- light touch of the foot to the ground
- short stride
- no bouncing

### Why shuffle?

My rucks have typically been at a (20min mile/6mph) pace.  I'm targetting a
better workout without committing a lot more time to the exercise.  If I can
reach a 50% distance increase with my ruck workouts, I will burn a LOT more
calories. I wanted to accomplish this safely though; running with an extra
~40lbs of weight on your back definitely doesn't sound like a good idea.  I've
already struggled with shin splints while running (without a ruck).

Jason McCarthy, founder of GoRuck, has a slight twist on on shuffling:
carrying a backpack of weight (a ruck) and he calls it the "ruck
shuffle".  I like it as a way to get more miles in without requiring as much of
a time commitment.  He talks about it in
[an interview by Peter Attia](https://youtu.be/yaEwGqXE2Vo?si=Gcb63Yq1l_yWczKi&t=8644).

Some of my takeaways from this interview:
- Running with weight increases risk of injury.
- Shuffling is a lower impact middle ground between walking and running.
- Shuffling is easier on the knees than the galloping movement of running,
  especially with increased weight from the ruck.
- Shuffling allows for more control in increasing heart rate during the workout.

I don't know if this is the origin of the shuffle, but I really enjoyed watching
this [documentary piece on the "Young Shuffle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PIph19-Csc).
A 61 year old old potato farmer, Cliff Young, decided to enter an ultramarathon and shuffled
his way into first place.

I did my first ruck shuffle [yesterday](/posts/2025-02-16-ruck-shuffle-day-1/),
and I think it's my favorite workout now.
