I ran a 5k while we were in Del Rio visiting Monica's folks this weekend.  This
was a first attempt benchmark.  I wanted to see how much of it I could actually
run and get a solid "before" snapshot.

A quick explanation of these numbers:
- the total race distance was 3.4 miles
- I completed that distance in 52 minutes and 58 seconds
- my average pace was 15 minutes and 33 seconds per mile

And I didn't die!

<br />

I was really happy to complete it (that was a milestone in
itself), but I was only able to run half of the distance.

I'm looking forward the training and lowering my completion time!
