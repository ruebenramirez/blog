# 2023-10-06 - Gear Update

My buddy John called it early: I'm a "gearhead". I love my gear.  I enjoy researching and finding my special "fit" for hobbies and interests. In tech, I love my keyboards.  In our RV travels, I've definitely found all kinds of backpacks and camping gear to geek out on.  Now that I've been rucking daily for a little while, I've started experimenting to find my special setup.  And I think I've found the winning combination.

### Running Shoes

When I first started walking, I just used the New Balance 993's that I kick around in daily.  As I added more miles, my feet started to ache, and I eventually found myself visiting the podiatrist with a stress-related injury.  My doctor recommended more cushion for the miles that I was covering.  I tried out a LOT of options, but felt right at home in these Brooks Glycerin 20s.  My feet love these shoes.

### Backpack

In order to ruck you can use any back you like, but I learned very quickly that wide and thickly padded shoulder straps are essential.  I was fortunate to have a great bag for carrying heavy loads long distances, comfortably.

It's a really simple bag with solid build quality.  I really like the story behind Recycled Firefighter.  Jake, the owner, is a great guy building cool stuff.  These backpacks tend to be out of stock often, so snag one if you see them available!

### Hydration Bladder

I've busted my fair share of hydration bladders.  They've always been relatively inexpensive, but super disappointing for use.  I
decided I wanted to invest in something more robust.

A lot of folks are happy with this hydration bladder from Source, so I snagged one.

### Ruck Plate

I started out by just loading as much random stuff as I could into my pack.  This was great for just getting started!  I decided since I've been really enjoying myself rucking almost daily, that it was time to up my game a little.  Instead of carrying 4 laptops in the heat, I'm switching to a single cast iron ruck plate.

I'm hoping to build up to a 30lb plate over the upcoming months, but I'm off to a great start!

Happy rucking!
