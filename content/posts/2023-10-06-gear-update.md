# 2023-10-06 - Gear Update

My buddy John called it early: I'm a "gearhead". I love my gear.  I enjoy researching and finding my special "fit" for hobbies and interests. In tech, I love my keyboards.  In our RV travels, I've definitely found all kinds of backpacks and camping gear to geek out on.  Now that I've been rucking daily for a little while, I've started experimenting to find my special setup.  And I think I've found the winning combination.

### Body Composition Smart Scale

I've been tracking my weight regularly for the past 3 months with a simple bathroom scale.  It's done a great job for that.  Now that I'm closing in on 60lbs lost, I want to start tracking the type of weight that I'm losing.  (targeting fat loss while adding muscle)  I don't expect any of these consumer-grade body composition scales to be very accurate, but I do expect to see some trends over time.

The Withings Body+ scale has been really great so far.  The iPhone app is intuitive and makes it easy to track total fat, visceral fat, muscle, BMI, and probably a whole bunch more.

### Running Shoes

When I first started walking, I just used the New Balance 993's that I kick around in daily.  As I added more miles, my feet started to ache, and I eventually found myself visiting the podiatrist with a stress-related injury.  My doctor recommended more cushion for the miles that I was covering.  I tried out a LOT of options, but felt right at home in these Brooks Glycerin 20s.  My feet love these shoes.

### Bone-conduction headphones

I've spent a lot of time walking lately.  This means I've had a lot of time to think and to listen to podcasts.  I have some Apple [Airpods](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/), but they don't stay in my ears very well and I always forget to charge them.  I have some [wired sony earbuds](https://www.sony.com/et/electronics/in-ear-headphones/mdr-xb55ap) that sound great and don't need to be charged so they end up being used more often.  I had a close call with a car though while I was running and listening to music.  I decided to look into open ear audio to be more aware of my surroundings.

I researched a bunch of different options but found these off-brand [bone-conducting headphones](https://a.co/d/0KeUqt3) that have been really great.  What's even nicer about these is that they're waterproof (not all models are) so I can use these while I'm in the pool also!  They're bluetooth (so still something to charge) but I'm a big fan of not being ran over, so it's an alright trade.

### Backpack

In order to ruck you can use any backpack you like, but I quickly learned that wide and thickly padded shoulder straps are essential.  I was fortunate to have a great bag for carrying heavy loads long distances, comfortably.

</p>

It's a really simple bag with solid build quality.  I really like the story behind Recycled Firefighter.  Jake, the owner, is a great guy building cool stuff.  These backpacks tend to be out of stock often, so snag one if you see them available!

### Hydration Bladder

I've busted my fair share of hydration bladders.  They've always been relatively inexpensive, but super disappointing for use.  I
decided I wanted to invest in something more robust.

A lot of folks are happy with this hydration bladder from Source, so I snagged one.

### Ruck Plate

I started out by just loading as much random stuff as I could into my pack.  This turned out great for getting started!  I decided since I've really enjoyed rucking almost daily, that it was time to up my game a little.  Instead of carrying 4 laptops in the heat, I'm switching to a single cast iron ruck plate.

I'm hoping to build up to a 30lb plate over the upcoming months, but I'm off to a great start for now!

Happy rucking!
