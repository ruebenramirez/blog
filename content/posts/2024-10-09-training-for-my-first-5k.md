I've walked some 5k events in the past, but I've never trained to run one from
start to finish.  I've felt inspired to start training to run and the C25k
approach seems like a well worn path to success.

I found [Garmin has some free training programs for running](https://connect.garmin.com/features/coach/).
One of the requirements for the training I'm signing up for is to commit to a
5k event sometime around mid December to mid January.

This will give me plenty of time to train and allow others to join in on the
fun.  Let me know if you're interested!
