I've walked a 5k but never trained to run one from start to finish.

I'm using [Garmin Coach Plans](https://connect.garmin.com/features/coach/) to
make this happen.  One of their recommendations is to sign up for a 5k race near
the end of the 8 to 15 weeks of training.  So Monica and I signed up to walk/run
this 5k in January.

It's far enough out to plan something outside of the holidays, so come join us!
