I've recently started [training to run a 5k](/posts/2024-10-09-training-for-my-first-5k/).

Today I reached a milestone that I want to celebrate: my fastest mile yet.

1 mile ran in 14 minutes and 44 seconds

I realize this is no earth shattering record.  It's a great starting point for
me as I'm getting started though!

I've also noticed I'm breathing better during workouts.  Ashthma has always been
an excuse to limit myself.  Now I'm surprised it's my leg muscles that tire
before my lungs give out.  My body actually adapting to overcome the stress of
the workouts is an amazing feeling.
