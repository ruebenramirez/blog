I've been slacking for about a week and a half.  We went hiking in Lost Maples
this last weekend and I overextended my knee while hiking down a steep decline.
I've been riding my eBike more, but if I'm honest, I'm probably babying it too
much.

So I was shocked today, when I learned I set a new personal record for fastest
mile: 13 minutes and 16 seconds.

Monica surprised me with a [5k on
Thanksgiving](https://runsignup.com/Race/TX/CedarPark/CedarParkTurkeyDay5K), and
I'm excited to see how well I do.  It's time to start getting those miles in
again!
