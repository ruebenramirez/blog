**TL;DR** I'm ecstatic with my most recent blood lab results!  The things that were most concerning on the original labs are either now corrected or showing significant improvement.

Over the past 2 months I’ve put in **A LOT** of work to become healthier:
- Started on Metformin and various vitamins and supplements
- Significantly cleaned up my diet
    - Whole foods (no processed or refined foods)
    - Keto (low carb, no sugar)
- Leveraged intermittent fasting
    - I’m averaging a 16:8 cycle.  (This is 16 hours of daily fasting followed by an 8 hour window for my meals.)
    - Once per week I’m completing an "extended" fast ranging from 24 - 36 hours.  I’m not pushing it beyond what feels “right”, for now.
- Targeted walking 20 miles per week


### On with the results

I completed some more blood work this past week and finally have the results to compare to the original [scary labs](/posts/blog-reboot/).

#### Problematic numbers that I’ve corrected back to normal range:
- Fasting Blood Glucose
- Sodium
- Calcium
- Platelet Count
- Triglycerides
- GGT

#### Problematic numbers that show improvement:

I've calculated some "improvement percentages" based on reference range for each result.  I'm getting very close to the reference range for each of these though!

##### Numbers originally way out of range:
- A1c: **77% improvement**
- Liver Enzymes
    - AST:  **65% improvement**
    - ALT:  **120% improvement**
- Bilirubin:  **42% improvement**
- Ferritin:  **21% improvement**

##### Not as far from range, so had less work to do here:
- Cholesterol
    - HDL: **5% improvement**
    - CHOL/HDLC Ratio: **4% improvement**
    - Non HDL Cholesterol: **1% improvement**

#### Numbers that haven't improved:

- LDL cholesterol

I actually expected to have more problems with my cholesterol with my low carb and high fat diet.  Given that **1)** I'm not far out of range for any related numbers here and **2)** my ratio of "good" to "bad" cholesterol is healthy...I'm not super concerned with this right now.  I do expect to see improvement over the upcoming months though.

### More info from latest labs

There are also some new lab results which are helping to paint a better picture of what exactly is going on with my liver.  I’ll save that info for another post.

I'm not done yet; there's still progress to be made.  For now, I'm very happy with the confirmation of the positive results from the work I'm putting in.  It's a great feeling having confidence I'm heading in the right direction.
