I added an intermittent [shuffle](/posts/2025-02-17-what-is-shuffling/)/jog to my rucks to pick up the pace.  I'm still
so slow.

My movements felt sloppy as I picked up the pace, but tightening my core brought
everything together. I felt the difference immediately, but I lack the strength
to sustain it for long. I'll need consistent practice to build up my endurance.

"Listen to your body" is something I've heard quite a bit, but it's finally
starting to click and make sense. Good stuff!
