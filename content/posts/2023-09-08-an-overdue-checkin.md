# 2023-09-08 Check-in

Original [OKRs post](/posts/okr-grids-for-health/) I'm tracking against.


### OKR Confidence

#### `(7/10)` Objective: Reshape my body
  - **Weight loss**
    - I've lost over 40lbs so far!
  - **Exercise**
    - I'm slowly building my walking mileage back up since my foot has healed.
    - Swimming has been a really great way to supplement some of those walking miles in the meantime.
    - We went out of town unexpectedly and I remained diligent with my longer walks...even with the incredibly hot temperatures.  Knocking those out felt great!
  - **Nutrition**
    - I took a break from whole foods keto diet and honestly kind of missed it.  I feel this was worth the "shock to my system" as an experiment.
      - Fast food just isn't appealing like it used to be.  Sweet things are just overly (and sickeningly? sweet)

#### `(9/10)` Objective: Understand my body and health issues.
- I've finished reading ["The Liver Cure" by Russell L. Blaylock](https://a.co/d/j4eg3hc).
  - I've learned so much from this book, from the basics of what makes up the liver, it's functions, what contributes to NAFLD, enzyme roles, what to supplement with, eat for a healthier liver and more.
  - I'm still working to summarize my notes into something more digestible and then I'll post them here.

#### `(8/10)` Objective: Implement sustainable lifestyle changes
- I think the radical changes I've made are starting to feel like a normal part of my day.
- I feel more confident in my ability to get up and get some activity in without the mental blocks I've had in the past.
  - My energy levels have been high and I generally feel more capable of taking on new challenges without the worries I've had.
  - Doing maintenance around the RV is no longer a draining chore.  These things have just become quick little tasks to knock out and then I keep going.

### Metrics

- <span class="metric-yellow">**Circuit Training**</span>
  - I've taken up swimming and it's much more difficult than I anticipated.  It's still not circuit training, but I'm getting the same benefit and staying cool in the Texas heat.
- <span class="metric-green">**20 miles per week walking/running**</span>
  - I hurt my foot a few weeks ago and started swimming to offset the loss in exercise from walking as much.  I now have some proper footwear and am back at it though!
- <span class="metric-red">**cook 5 healthy meals**</span>
  - We visited some family in Del Rio and I took a mini vacation from my strict dieting.  It wasn't the best idea, since I felt really bad after some of the meal choices.  It's good to be back in the keto flow of things though.
  - Monica bought an air fryer for us that I'm really excited to check out.
- <span class="metric-red">**blog post per week**</span>
  - I've been slacking!  There are plenty of excuses I could raise, but my aim going forward will be to reduce the effort required to post in order to maintain consistency.
  - THANK YOU to those of you that are keeping me honest and asking me for an update!
- <span class="metric-green">**discipline of morning/evening routine**</span>
  - This has been less and less an issue over the past few weeks.
  - Going to sleep early and getting up early feels good and allows me to be more productive.
- <span class="metric-yellow">**8 hours of sleep**</span>
  - I've been hovering around 6-7 hours a night.
  - I need to research how necessary a full 8 hours is *every* night.
- <span class="metric-green">**meds/supplements**</span>
  - My doctors are already making plans for taking me off of Metformin in November since my blood work results are looking so great!

### Pipeline

- **Visited with the Hepatologist**
  - We reviewed my recent blood work and compared it to my starting point.
  - We are all very happy with my progress.  I was told to "keep doing what I'm doing, and we'll see you in 12 months."
  - My primary care is already interested in taking me off of some of the medications I started to manage my A1c and blood glucose levels.
- **Foot woes**
  - I visited a podiatrist and it turns out I caught things early enough that there weren't any stress fractures to deal with.  I switched my shoes out for some with more cushion support, and I'm back in the game.  I'm taking it easy to build back up to the mileage I was hitting before though.

### Priorities for next week

P1s = must do
P2s = should do

- **P1: Complete three 5 mile walks this week**
- **P1: Reading [Glucose Revolution](https://a.co/d/7i195Y8) by the [Glucose Goddess](https://www.glucosegoddess.com).**
- **P1: add newsletter functionality to this blog**
- **P1: share my notes from "The Liver Cure"**
- **P2: improve blog dev to make it easier to post**
