## 2023-10-23 - Round 2 With Covid

I recently had a [liver biopsy](/posts/2023-10-21-liver-biopsy/) in San Antonio, and we decided that it would be safer for me to recover in a hotel closer to the medical center area of town.  We got Covid halfway through our stay at the hotel.  All things considered, I'm glad I recovered with the peace of mind of being close to emergency care if needed.

Covid definitely wasn't on my radar but it should have been: Monica and I both have friends and family that have struggled with covid over just the past few weeks.

Thankfully this time around was much easier to manage.  I was fortunate to get through the abdomen pain from the liver biopsy before the fever and coughing from covid started up.  If you have to go through both, it's definitely ideal to deal with one and then the other.  We stayed a few extra days in the hotel to get through some fever symptoms to ensure it wasn't related to the biopsy and then made our way home.  It's now a week later and I'm starting to feel a little more like my old self each day.
