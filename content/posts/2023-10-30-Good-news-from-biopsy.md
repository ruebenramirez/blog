# 2023-10-30 - Good news from my biopsy

Not too long ago, I had a [Fibroscan that provided some really scary results](/posts/2023-09-14-bad-news-from-first-fibroscan/).  Because of those results, my doctors recommended a liver biopsy.

That biopsy gave us some really good news:
- My recent liver biopsy results show that **I've now brought the level of fat in my liver (steatosis) to normal range**.  This is important because it will allow my liver to begin healing.
- The other large takeaway is that my **liver damage (fibrosis) was downgraded from stage 4 to stage 2**.  This means that my liver is not nearly as damaged as the Fibroscan imaging showed it to be.  There's a lot more hope that my liver is capable of healing, given the lifestyle changes I've made.

**I'm officially in a healing and monitoring phase now.**  The plan is to schedule another Fibroscan in 6 months and again in 1 year.  Without further complications, we get to consider all of this a thing of the past.

I have some theories about the discrepancies between the Fibroscan imaging and these biopsy results.  I have been aggressively losing weight which may have stressed my liver around the time of the Fibroscan.

So, what now?  I'm almost over this [covid crud](/posts/2023-10-21-round-2-with-covid/).  I'm starting back into exercise slowly with walking: babysteps on the treadmill, adding some miles, then jumping back into rucking on trails.
