# 2023-08-15 Check-in

I have [some OKRs defined](/posts/okr-grids-for-health/), and it's time to see how I'm tracking!

I've actually been working out and experimenting with diet changes for about
6 weeks now.  That said, I have a lot to figure out still.

Time for a first check-in post!

### OKR Confidence

Starting with my OKRs, I feel I've started strong.

#### `(7/10)` Objective: Reshape my body
  - **Weight loss**
    - I've lost right at 20lbs through diet and exercise, since the beginning of July.
  - **Exercise**
    - Walking highlights
      - `28 miles` this past week
      - `> 8 miles` in one day

    - My legs have been aching and building up more from the frequency of my longer walks.
  - **Nutrition**
    - I've stuck with a low carb, whole foods, diet for the past month with 3 small exceptions.  Each of those exceptions caused me to have terrible stomach aches...so really great motivation for eating healthier!
    - I completed a 24 hour water-only fast.  I was able to handle this much more easily than I expected to be able to.
    - I'm focusing on adding protein to help my recovery effort.  This also helps me stay full and away from snacking.

#### `(8/10)` Objective: Understand my body and health issues.
  - **Podcasts I'm listening to**
    - My friend Patrick recommended some incredibly helpful podcasts that I've listened to over and over again on my longer walks.
      - [The worst intermittent fasting mistakes that lead to weight gain](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/impact-theory-with-tom-bilyeu/id1191775648?i=1000614113249)
      - [Diet Masterclass: What to eat, When to eat & How to eat for longetivity](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/impact-theory-with-tom-bilyeu/id1191775648?i=1000609775759)
    - [NASHNET - NAFLD/NASH Education series](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/nafld-nash-education-series/id1515385740)
    - My friend Bijan recommended [Huberman Lab](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/huberman-lab/id1545953110).
      - I haven't listened to this yet but Bijan's recommendations are always spot on, so I'm really looking forward to it.
  - **Books I'm reading**
    - [The Liver Cure by Dr. Russell L. Blaylock](https://a.co/d/gGP9UEr)
      - Our biology continues to amaze me as I learn more about how we're put together.  This book has so far made it very easy to understand how the liver works and what it is capable of.
    - [Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H453KGH?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_KBRPRZMSEQC3S46YKZD6)
      - This is a great motivational book.  Each chapter ends with an exercise to help personalize the material and make progress on your challenges.

#### `(6/10)` Objective: Implement sustainable lifestyle changes
  - I've been leaning really heavily on walking throughout the day.  This has helped me get started, but going forward I need to shift more heavily into an active morning routine.  So far my mornings have been somewhat lax.
  - We've found more restaurants with healthy options.  I have found filling salads that I actually like at Jason's Deli, McAlister's Deli.  At most steak houses, I've been able to find a great salad or a large baked or grilled chicken option.
  - I've always been a picky eater, but I'm starting to explore different vegetables and surprising myself from time to time.


### Metrics

- <span class="metric-red">**Circuit Training**</span>
  - I still haven't been to the gym yet.  It's hot in Texas though, so that will happen any day now.
- <span class="metric-green">**20 miles per week walking/running**</span>
  - I did it!
- <span class="metric-yellow">**cook 5 healthy meals**</span>
  - we've eaten out more than I care to admit, but we have kept it low carb and whole foods based.
- <span class="metric-green">**blog post per week**</span>
  - I did it!
- <span class="metric-yellow">**discipline of morning/evening routine**</span>
  - still a little rocky, but getting better.
  - Losing an hour to a timezone change (Eastern -> Central) didn't help things.
  - We are getting up early consistently though!
- <span class="metric-yellow">**8 hours of sleep**</span>
  - This is getting better, but it's not quite consistent enough.
- <span class="metric-green">**meds/supplements**</span>
  - I've never done well taking meds regularly.
  - I switched from a 3-a-day to a 2-a-day metformin, so that's making it much easier!


### Pipeline

- **Travel day stress**
  - Our travel this past weekend was incredibly stressful.
  - That caused some sleep issues, and my glucose levels were not as stable.
  - I did manage to stay on top of a healthy diet though!
  - We also got a quick walk in while stopped at a rest area! This is a first for our travel days.

- **Blood labs round 3**
  - I had more blood drawn for some labs prior to my 1st hepotologist appointment next week.
  - I'm really looking forward to seeing the comparison of these numbers to previous blood labs from a month ago, given all the effort I've put into diet and exercise.
- **Getting back home**
  - We're completing our final travel days for this extended (6 months?!) road trip, this weekend.
  - We'll be North of San Antonio and South of Austin, in a smaller town called New Braunfels.  We're looking forward to being around friends and family again!

### Priorities

Last weeks priorities:
- **P1: `< 2` CGM spikes per day**
  - I did it!  This was mostly diet, but a few times I did lean on some exercise after a meal with some carbs.
  - This first week has been incredibly informative.  I've learned to expect a spike after a fast, pretty much no matter what I eat.  And also that I can leverage some exercise after a bigger meal to stay on top of spikes.
- **P1: cover 20 miles of walking**
  - This was my first week actually keeping track of all the walking I've done.  It's great to know that I'm hitting this baseline.
- **P1: blog post: 1st check-in**
  - you're reading it!
- **P1: blog post: OKR Grid**
  - tracking my progress via [my Health OKR Grid](/posts/okr-grids-for-health/)
- **P2: 1 day water fast**
  - I've completed 2 of these: one last week and the other this week.
  - This seems to be easier to do than I remember attempts from the past.  I'm sure the diet is helping on this front.
- **P2: find some podcasts**
  - Thanks to awesome friends, I have some really great material to get started with.
