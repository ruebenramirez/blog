## OKR Grids for Health

If you haven't at least skimmed my blog reboot post yet, it might be helpful to understand [why I'm doing all of this](/posts/blog-reboot/).

### How to read an OKR Grid:

My Health OKR Grid is inspired by Christina Wodtkey’s "Four Square" tool in her book [Radical Focus](https://a.co/d/02uWA5h).

- Read the grid clockwise.
- We start with **OKRs** to set and remind ourselves of our foundational goals: OKRs are
  - Objectives - the inspirational “What”
  - Key Results - aka KRs or the “how we know we’ve met our goal”
- Next, **Metrics** help us ensure that we’re maintaining the things that matter most while continuing to press forward on new developments.
- **Pipeline** is the list of things that we envision coming up or being a part of the near future.
- **Priorities** are active commitments, this week, to progress forward in meeting our goals.
