A few friends I've worked with over the past few years have been heavy
contributors to Southern California Linux Expo
([SCaLE](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x)).  It's an
all-things-open-source tech conference where they have put together a very
capable (not to be confused with complicated) network for attendees to use.

It's very impressive what this small team has put together.  When I attended
this past March, everything worked almost flawlessly.  Any hiccups were quickly
addressed and things kept humming along.

This is an incredibly talented group of folks and I'm excited to learn from
them.

Some things I'm looking forward to jumping into:

- Nix flake for Raspberry Pi image building (for Registration Kiosks and Signage
round the conference)
- Networking services (DHCP, DNS, etc.) deployed to onsite infrastructure
- Custom OpenWRT builds for deployed access points
- Potential for Liminix builds for Access Point software configuration
