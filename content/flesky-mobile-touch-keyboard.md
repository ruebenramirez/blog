* first iOS third party keyboard (only on iOS8, since this is a new feature of iOS8)
* works pretty well on my nexus 5
* I don't like the android tablet keyboard, so I'm hoping that this will be an improvement.  (the only way I can type reasonably well on my nexus 7 is to hold it in portait mode)
* The apple wireless keyboard + the incase origami workstation stand/keyboard housing still provides the best tablet typing experience.
